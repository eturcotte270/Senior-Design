# Project Constraints

#### Economic
My goal for this project is to have no expenses. That means using free software and site hosting services. This is a challenge as many site hosting services are not free and therefore options will be limited. It also makes it challenging to have a secure site using https since certificates cost money so I will use alternative methods to securing the application. My ideal deployment would be to have a Java Web Application and deploy it on a server but need to find a way to accomplish this without any expense.

#### Security
Since users will be able to create a profile to track which stadiums they have attended and store potential trips, data needs to be secured. There is not much PII such as credit card numbers and addresses but emails and passwords are being stored. Most importantly users will not want their passwords being leaked so security needs to be addressed. One main way of securing a site is using https but that often has an associated expense which I am trying to avoid. Other security measures are going to be looked into to help prevent data leaks. Some initial ideas are preventing SQL injections and encoding data.

#### Time
Since this project is limited to 2 semesters and I am the only one working on it, I have to scale application features. I hav created a modular approach where features can be added incrementally. In order to create a full scale application (as close as possible), I have set an aggressive timeline to accomplish tasks. I have allowed some extra time over breaks and a week before the expo to allow a little room in case some tasks take longer than expected.
