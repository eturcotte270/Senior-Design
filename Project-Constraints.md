# Project Constraints

#### Economic
My goal for this project is for it to be free or with minimal cost. That means using all software and site hosting services that are free. This is a challenge as many site hosting services are not free and therefore options will be limited. It also makes it challenging to have a secure site using https since certificates typically cost money so I will be looking for ways to accomplish this or use alternative methods to securing the application. My ideal deployment would be to have a Java Web Application and deploy it on a server but need to find a way to accomplish this without fees.

#### Security
Since users will be able to create a profile to track which stadiums they have attended and store potential trips, data needs to be secured. There is not much PII such as credit card numbers and addresses but emails and passwords are being stored. Most importantly users will not want their passwords being leaked so security needs to be addressed. One main way of securing a site is using https but that often has an associated fee which I am trying to avoid. Other security measures are going to be looked into to help prevent data leaks.

#### Time
Since this project is limited to 2 semesters and I am the only one working on it, I had to scale application features to a reasonable amount. I have set the design to add/remove certain features as time allows. In order to create a full scale application (as close as possible), I have set an aggressive timeline to accomplish tasks. I have allowed some extra time over breaks and a week before the expo to allow a little room in case some tasks take longer than expected.
